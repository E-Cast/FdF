args:
	1 == filename
	2 == case_size
	3 == z_size
If no args or too many args:
	prints "Usage : ./fdf_linux <filename> [ case_size z_size ]"
If arg 1 is invalid filename
	prints "No file <filename>"
If file has no perms
	prints "No file <filename>"
If file can't be read
	prints "No data found."
in maps
	lines must all have the same number of elelemnts
	elements must be seperated by whitespace (spaces, tabs and maybe more)
	maps do not need to end with .fdf



Plan:
	Open file
	new_row == first row read from file
	if (new_row == invalid)
		print "No data found."
	while (new_row == valid)
		draw_row(new_row, last_row)
		last_row == first_row
		first_row == new_row read from file


	draw_row
